# Dog Breed Classification using MobileNetV2

This repository contains a deep learning model built for classifying dog breeds using the MobileNetV2 architecture. The model is trained on a large dataset of dog images with labeled breed information.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is a collection of dog images, where each image is associated with a specific dog breed label. The dataset consists of a diverse range of dog breeds, allowing the model to learn the distinguishing features of each breed.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model is based on the MobileNetV2 architecture, which is a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for mobile and embedded devices. MobileNetV2 provides a good balance between model size and accuracy, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

The model consists of multiple layers of depthwise separable convolutions, followed by global average pooling and a fully connected layer for classification. MobileNetV2 has been pre-trained on a large-scale dataset and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as dog breed classification.

## Training

The model is trained using a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques. The pre-trained MobileNetV2 model is used as the initial backbone, and only the last few layers are fine-tuned using the dog breed dataset. This approach allows the model to leverage the knowledge learned from a larger dataset while adapting it to the specific classification task.

During training, the model learns to recognize the distinguishing features of different dog breeds by minimizing a loss function, such as categorical cross-entropy. The training process involves iterating over the training dataset, adjusting the model's parameters using backpropagation, and updating the weights through an optimizer.

## Usage

To use the trained model for classifying dog breeds, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Load the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model and the trained weights.
3. Preprocess the input image by resizing it to the appropriate dimensions and normalizing pixel values.
4. Feed the preprocessed image into the model and obtain the predicted probabilities for each dog breed.
5. Optionally, select the top-k predictions with the highest probabilities to identify the most likely dog breeds.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy. These metric provide an assessment of how well the model generalizes to unseen dog images and accurately predicts their breeds.
